    "for the rest of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were\n",
    "mistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than\n",

    "pleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember\n",
    "saying to myself, as I drove to the house, \"I like this man, pray Heaven\n",
    "no harm come of it!\" But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in\n",
    "mind my being only four months a widow, and to be as quiet as possible:\n",
    "and I have been so, my dear creature; I have admitted no one's\n",
    "attentions but Mainwaring's. I have avoided all general flirtation\n",
    "whatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all the numbers\n",
    "resorting hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little\n",
    "notice, in order to detach him from Miss Mainwaring; but, if the world\n",
    "could know my motive THERE they would honour me. I have been called an\n",
    "unkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse of maternal affection, it\n",
    "was the advantage of my daughter that led me on; and if that daughter\n",
    "were not the greatest simpleton on earth, I might have been rewarded for\n",
    "my exertions as I ought.\n",

    "Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who\n",
    "was born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so violently\n",
    "against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for\n",
    "the present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him\n",
    "myself; and were he but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly\n",
    "should: but I must own myself rather romantic in that respect, and\n",
    "that riches only will not satisfy me. The event of all this is very\n",
    "provoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly incensed, and Mrs. Mainwaring\n",
    "insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so enraged against\n",
    "me, that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be surprized at her\n",
    "appealing to her guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him:\n",
    "but there your husband stands my friend; and the kindest, most amiable\n",
    "action of his life was his throwing her off for ever on her marriage.\n",
    "Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you. We are now in a sad\n",
    "state; no house was ever more altered; the whole party are at war, and\n",
    "Mainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is time for me to be gone; I\n",
    "have therefore determined on leaving them, and shall spend, I hope, a\n",
    "comfortable day with you in town within this week. If I am as little\n",
    "in favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must come to me at 10 Wigmore\n",
    "street; but I hope this may not be the case, for as Mr. Johnson, with\n",
    "all his faults, is a man to whom that great word \"respectable\" is always\n",
    "given, and I am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me\n",
    "has an awkward look.\n",
    "\n",
    "I take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village;\n",
    "for I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is\n",
    "my last resource. Were there another place in England open to me I would\n",
    "prefer it. Charles Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife.\n",
    "At Churchhill, however, I must remain till I have something better in\n",
    "view. My young lady accompanies me to town, where I shall deposit her\n",
    "under the care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she becomes a\n",
    "little more reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the\n",
    "girls are all of the best families. The price is immense, and much\n",

    "prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to\n",

    "declared her intention of visiting us almost immediately; and as such\n",
    "a visit is in all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is\n",
    "impossible to conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for such\n",
    "an event, nor can I now account for her ladyship's conduct; Langford\n",
    "appeared so exactly the place for her in every respect, as well from\n",
    "the elegant and expensive style of living there, as from her particular\n",
    "attachment to Mr. Mainwaring, that I was very far from expecting so\n",
    "speedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her increasing\n",
    "friendship for us since her husband's death that we should, at some\n",
    "future period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a\n",
    "great deal too kind to her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour\n",
    "to him, independent of her general character, has been so inexcusably\n",
    "artful and ungenerous since our marriage was first in agitation that no\n",
    "one less amiable and mild than himself could have overlooked it all;\n",
    "and though, as his brother's widow, and in narrow circumstances, it was\n",
    "proper to render her pecuniary assistance, I cannot help thinking\n",
    "his pressing invitation to her to visit us at Churchhill perfectly\n",
    "unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always is to think the best of\n",
    "everyone, her display of grief, and professions of regret, and general\n",
    "resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his heart and make\n",
    "him really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I am still\n",
    "unconvinced, and plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot\n",
    "make up my mind till I better understand her real meaning in coming to\n",
    "us. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam, with what feelings I look\n",
    "forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for all those attractive\n",
    "powers for which she is celebrated to gain any share of my regard; and\n",
    "I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against their influence,\n",
    "if not accompanied by something more substantial. She expresses a\n",
    "most eager desire of being acquainted with me, and makes very gracious\n",
    "mention of my children but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a woman\n",
    "who has behaved with inattention, if not with unkindness, to her own\n",
    "child, should be attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be placed at\n",

    "very distinguished flirt I have always been taught to consider her, but\n",
    "it has lately fallen in my way to hear some particulars of her conduct\n",
    "at Langford: which prove that she does not confine herself to that sort\n",
    "of honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires to the\n",
    "more delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable. By her\n",
    "behaviour to Mr. Mainwaring she gave jealousy and wretchedness to his\n",

    "I received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left town, and\n",
    "rejoice to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your\n",
    "engagement the evening before. It is undoubtedly better to deceive him\n",
    "entirely, and since he will be stubborn he must be tricked. I arrived\n",
    "here in safety, and have no reason to complain of my reception from Mr.\n",
    "Vernon; but I confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour of\n",
    "his lady. She is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a woman\n",
    "of fashion, but her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being\n",
    "prepossessed in my favour. I wanted her to be delighted at seeing me.\n",
    "I was as amiable as possible on the occasion, but all in vain. She does\n",
    "not like me. To be sure when we consider that I DID take some pains to\n",
    "prevent my brother-in-law's marrying her, this want of cordiality is not\n",
    "very surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and vindictive spirit\n",
    "to resent a project which influenced me six years ago, and which never\n",
    "succeeded at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy\n",
    "Vernon Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying\n",
    "circumstance, especially as the sale took place exactly at the time\n",
    "of his marriage; and everybody ought to respect the delicacy of those\n",
    "feelings which could not endure that my husband's dignity should be\n",
    "lessened by his younger brother's having possession of the family\n",
    "estate. Could matters have been so arranged as to prevent the necessity\n",
    "of our leaving the castle, could we have lived with Charles and kept\n",
    "him single, I should have been very far from persuading my husband to\n",
    "dispose of it elsewhere; but Charles was on the point of marrying\n",
    "Miss De Courcy, and the event has justified me. Here are children in\n",
    "abundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me from his purchasing\n",
    "Vernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given his wife an\n",
    "unfavourable impression, but where there is a disposition to dislike,\n",
    "a motive will never be wanting; and as to money matters it has not\n",
    "withheld him from being very useful to me. I really have a regard\n",
    "for him, he is so easily imposed upon! The house is a good one, the\n",
    "furniture fashionable, and everything announces plenty and elegance.\n",
    "Charles is very rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a\n",
    "banking-house he rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with\n",
    "it, keep very little company, and never go to London but on business. We\n",
    "shall be as stupid as possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law's heart\n",
    "through the children; I know all their names already, and am going to\n",

    "sake.\n",

    "Poor Mainwaring! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how\n",

    "Well, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature, and must\n",

    "form your own judgment. She is really excessively pretty; however you may\n",
    "choose to question the allurements of a lady no longer young, I must,\n",
    "for my own part, declare that I have seldom seen so lovely a woman\n",
    "as Lady Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and dark\n",
    "eyelashes; and from her appearance one would not suppose her more than\n",
    "five and twenty, though she must in fact be ten years older, I was\n",
    "certainly not disposed to admire her, though always hearing she was\n",
    "beautiful; but I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon\n",
    "union of symmetry, brilliancy, and grace. Her address to me was so\n",
    "gentle, frank, and even affectionate, that, if I had not known how much\n",
    "she has always disliked me for marrying Mr. Vernon, and that we had\n",
    "never met before, I should have imagined her an attached friend. One\n",
    "is apt, I believe, to connect assurance of manner with coquetry, and to\n",
    "expect that an impudent address will naturally attend an impudent mind;\n",
    "at least I was myself prepared for an improper degree of confidence in\n",
    "Lady Susan; but her countenance is absolutely sweet, and her voice and\n",
    "manner winningly mild. I am sorry it is so, for what is this but deceit?\n",
    "Unfortunately, one knows her too well. She is clever and agreeable, has\n",
    "all that knowledge of the world which makes conversation easy, and talks\n",
    "very well, with a happy command of language, which is too often used, I\n",
    "believe, to make black appear white. She has already almost persuaded me\n",
    "of her being warmly attached to her daughter, though I have been so long\n",
    "convinced to the contrary. She speaks of her with so much tenderness and\n",
    "anxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect of her education, which she\n",
    "represents however as wholly unavoidable, that I am forced to recollect\n",
    "how many successive springs her ladyship spent in town, while her\n",
    "daughter was left in Staffordshire to the care of servants, or a\n",
    "governess very little better, to prevent my believing what she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "If her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart, you\n",
    "may judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon's generous\n",
    "temper. I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that it was really\n",
    "her choice to leave Langford for Churchhill; and if she had not stayed\n",
    "there for months before she discovered that her friend's manner of\n",
    "living did not suit her situation or feelings, I might have believed\n",
    "that concern for the loss of such a husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her\n",
    "own behaviour was far from unexceptionable, might for a time make her\n",
    "wish for retirement. But I cannot forget the length of her visit to the\n",
    "Mainwarings, and when I reflect on the different mode of life which she\n",
    "led with them from that to which she must now submit, I can only suppose\n",
    "that the wish of establishing her reputation by following though late\n",
    "the path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a family where she\n",
    "must in reality have been particularly happy. Your friend Mr. Smith's\n",
    "story, however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds regularly\n",

    "inspired him with greater respect for me than his sister's kind offices\n",
    "have implanted, he may be an agreeable flirt. There is exquisite\n",
    "pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a person\n",

    "He desires me to tell you that the present open weather induces him to\n",
    "accept Mr. Vernon's invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that\n",
    "they may have some hunting together. He means to send for his horses\n",

    "fascination towards her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon, and\n",
    "of course I cannot receive that pleasure from the length of his visit\n",
    "which my brother's company would otherwise give me. I am, indeed,\n",
    "provoked at the artifice of this unprincipled woman; what stronger\n",
    "proof of her dangerous abilities can be given than this perversion of\n",
    "Reginald's judgment, which when he entered the house was so decidedly\n",
    "against her! In his last letter he actually gave me some particulars of\n",
    "her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a gentleman who knew\n",
    "her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise abhorrence against her,\n",
    "and which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit. His opinion\n",
    "of her, I am sure, was as low as of any woman in England; and when he\n",
    "first came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither\n",
    "to delicacy nor respect, and that he felt she would be delighted with\n",
    "the attentions of any man inclined to flirt with her. Her behaviour, I\n",
    "confess, has been calculated to do away with such an idea; I have\n",
    "not detected the smallest impropriety in it--nothing of vanity, of\n",
    "pretension, of levity; and she is altogether so attractive that I should\n",
    "not wonder at his being delighted with her, had he known nothing of her\n",
    "previous to this personal acquaintance; but, against reason, against\n",
    "conviction, to be so well pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does\n",
    "really astonish me. His admiration was at first very strong, but no more\n",
    "than was natural, and I did not wonder at his being much struck by the\n",
    "gentleness and delicacy of her manners; but when he has mentioned her of\n",
    "late it has been in terms of more extraordinary praise; and yesterday he\n",
    "actually said that he could not be surprised at any effect produced\n",
    "on the heart of man by such loveliness and such abilities; and when I\n",
    "lamented, in reply, the badness of her disposition, he observed that\n",
    "whatever might have been her errors they were to be imputed to her\n",
    "neglected education and early marriage, and that she was altogether a\n",
    "wonderful woman. This tendency to excuse her conduct or to forget it, in\n",
    "the warmth of admiration, vexes me; and if I did not know that Reginald\n",
    "is too much at home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening\n",
    "his visit, I should regret Mr. Vernon's giving him any. Lady Susan's\n",

    "more decided. I have subdued him entirely by sentiment and serious\n",

    "My dear Sir,--I have this moment received your letter, which has given\n",
    "me more astonishment than I ever felt before. I am to thank my sister,\n",
    "I suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure me\n",
    "in your opinion, and give you all this alarm. I know not why she should\n",
    "choose to make herself and her family uneasy by apprehending an\n",
    "event which no one but herself, I can affirm, would ever have thought\n",
    "possible. To impute such a design to Lady Susan would be taking from her\n",
    "every claim to that excellent understanding which her bitterest enemies\n",
    "have never denied her; and equally low must sink my pretensions to\n",
    "common sense if I am suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour\n",
    "to her. Our difference of age must be an insuperable objection, and I\n",
    "entreat you, my dear father, to quiet your mind, and no longer harbour\n",
    "a suspicion which cannot be more injurious to your own peace than to our\n",
    "understandings. I can have no other view in remaining with Lady Susan,\n",
    "than to enjoy for a short time (as you have yourself expressed it) the\n",
    "conversation of a woman of high intellectual powers. If Mrs. Vernon\n",
    "would allow something to my affection for herself and her husband in the\n",
    "length of my visit, she would do more justice to us all; but my sister\n",
    "is unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope of conviction against Lady\n",
    "Susan. From an attachment to her husband, which in itself does honour to\n",
    "both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at preventing their union, which\n",
    "have been attributed to selfishness in Lady Susan; but in this case, as\n",
    "well as in many others, the world has most grossly injured that lady, by\n",
    "supposing the worst where the motives of her conduct have been doubtful.\n",
    "Lady Susan had heard something so materially to the disadvantage of my\n",
    "sister as to persuade her that the happiness of Mr. Vernon, to whom she\n",
    "was always much attached, would be wholly destroyed by the marriage. And\n",
    "this circumstance, while it explains the true motives of Lady Susan's\n",
    "conduct, and removes all the blame which has been so lavished on her,\n",
    "may also convince us how little the general report of anyone ought to\n",
    "be credited; since no character, however upright, can escape the\n",
    "malevolence of slander. If my sister, in the security of retirement,\n",
    "with as little opportunity as inclination to do evil, could not avoid\n",
    "censure, we must not rashly condemn those who, living in the world and\n",

    "the superior attractions of another woman, the chance of being able to\n",
    "make a worthy man completely wretched. Lady Susan was far from intending\n",
    "such a conquest, and on finding how warmly Miss Mainwaring resented her\n",
    "lover's defection, determined, in spite of Mr. and Mrs. Mainwaring's\n",
    "most urgent entreaties, to leave the family. I have reason to imagine\n",

    "My dear Mother,--Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his\n",
    "niece with him. Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day's\n",
    "post, informing her that Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow of\n",
    "Miss Vernon's continuance in her academy; we were therefore prepared for\n",
    "her arrival, and expected them impatiently the whole evening. They came\n",
    "while we were at tea, and I never saw any creature look so frightened as\n",
    "Frederica when she entered the room. Lady Susan, who had been shedding\n",
    "tears before, and showing great agitation at the idea of the meeting,\n",
    "received her with perfect self-command, and without betraying the\n",
    "least tenderness of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, and on Frederica's\n",
    "bursting into tears as soon as we were seated, took her out of the room,\n",
    "and did not return for some time. When she did, her eyes looked very red\n",
    "and she was as much agitated as before. We saw no more of her daughter.\n",
    "Poor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his fair friend in\n",
    "such distress, and watched her with so much tender solicitude, that I,\n",
    "who occasionally caught her observing his countenance with exultation,\n",
    "was quite out of patience. This pathetic representation lasted the whole\n",
    "evening, and so ostentatious and artful a display has entirely convinced\n",
    "me that she did in fact feel nothing. I am more angry with her than ever\n",
    "since I have seen her daughter; the poor girl looks so unhappy that my\n",
    "heart aches for her. Lady Susan is surely too severe, for Frederica\n",
    "does not seem to have the sort of temper to make severity necessary.\n",
    "She looks perfectly timid, dejected, and penitent. She is very\n",
    "pretty, though not so handsome as her mother, nor at all like her. Her\n",
    "complexion is delicate, but neither so fair nor so blooming as Lady\n",
    "Susan's, and she has quite the Vernon cast of countenance, the oval face\n",
    "and mild dark eyes, and there is peculiar sweetness in her look when she\n",
    "speaks either to her uncle or me, for as we behave kindly to her we have\n",
    "of course engaged her gratitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her mother has insinuated that her temper is intractable, but I never\n",
    "saw a face less indicative of any evil disposition than hers; and from\n",
    "what I can see of the behaviour of each to the other, the invariable\n",
    "severity of Lady Susan and the silent dejection of Frederica, I am\n",
    "led to believe as heretofore that the former has no real love for her\n",
    "daughter, and has never done her justice or treated her affectionately.\n",
    "I have not been able to have any conversation with my niece; she is shy,\n",
    "and I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her being\n",
    "much with me. Nothing satisfactory transpires as to her reason for\n",
    "running away. Her kind-hearted uncle, you may be sure, was too fearful\n",
    "of distressing her to ask many questions as they travelled. I wish it\n",
    "had been possible for me to fetch her instead of him. I think I should\n",
    "have discovered the truth in the course of a thirty-mile journey. The\n",
    "small pianoforte has been removed within these few days, at Lady Susan's\n",
    "request, into her dressing-room, and Frederica spends great part of the\n",
    "day there, practising as it is called; but I seldom hear any noise when\n",
    "I pass that way; what she does with herself there I do not know. There\n",
    "are plenty of books, but it is not every girl who has been running\n",
    "wild the first fifteen years of her life, that can or will read. Poor\n",
    "creature! the prospect from her window is not very instructive, for that\n",
    "room overlooks the lawn, you know, with the shrubbery on one side,\n",
    "where she may see her mother walking for an hour together in earnest\n",
    "conversation with Reginald. A girl of Frederica's age must be childish\n",
    "indeed, if such things do not strike her. Is it not inexcusable to give\n",
    "such an example to a daughter? Yet Reginald still thinks Lady Susan the\n",
    "best of mothers, and still condemns Frederica as a worthless girl! He\n",
    "is convinced that her attempt to run away proceeded from no, justifiable\n",
    "cause, and had no provocation. I am sure I cannot say that it HAD,\n",
    "but while Miss Summers declares that Miss Vernon showed no signs of\n",
    "obstinacy or perverseness during her whole stay in Wigmore Street, till\n",
    "she was detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily credit what Lady\n",
    "Susan has made him, and wants to make me believe, that it was merely\n",
    "an impatience of restraint and a desire of escaping from the tuition of\n",
    "masters which brought on the plan of an elopement. O Reginald, how is\n",
    "your judgment enslaved! He scarcely dares even allow her to be handsome,\n",
    "and when I speak of her beauty, replies only that her eyes have no\n",
    "brilliancy! Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in understanding, and\n",
    "at others that her temper only is in fault. In short, when a person is\n",
    "always to deceive, it is impossible to be consistent. Lady Susan\n",
    "finds it necessary that Frederica should be to blame, and probably has\n",
    "sometimes judged it expedient to excuse her of ill-nature and sometimes\n",
    "to lament her want of sense. Reginald is only repeating after her\n",

    "perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect of\n",
    "it frightened her so thoroughly, that, with a mixture of true girlish\n",
    "perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting out of the house and\n",
    "proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had\n",
    "really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when\n",

    "is not enough; her affections must also be given without her mother's\n",

    "being ridiculous, and despised by every man who sees her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a\n",
    "simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet\n",
    "certain that Reginald sees what she is about, nor is it of much\n",
    "consequence. She is now an object of indifference to him, and she would\n",
    "be one of contempt were he to understand her emotions. Her beauty is\n",
    "much admired by the Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in high\n",
    "favour with her aunt altogether, because she is so little like myself,\n",
    "of course. She is exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly\n",
    "loves to be firm, and to have all the sense and all the wit of the\n",

    "We have a very unexpected guest with us at present, my dear Mother: he\n",
    "arrived yesterday. I heard a carriage at the door, as I was sitting with\n",
    "my children while they dined; and supposing I should be wanted, left the\n",

    "as pale as ashes, came running up, and rushed by me into her own room.\n",
    "I instantly followed, and asked her what was the matter. \"Oh!\" said\n",
    "she, \"he is come--Sir James is come, and what shall I do?\" This was no\n",
    "explanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At that moment we\n",
    "were interrupted by a knock at the door: it was Reginald, who came, by\n",
    "Lady Susan's direction, to call Frederica down. \"It is Mr. De Courcy!\"\n",

    "terrified face of Frederica with surprize. In the breakfast-room we\n",
    "found Lady Susan, and a young man of gentlemanlike appearance, whom she\n",
    "introduced by the name of Sir James Martin--the very person, as you may\n",
    "remember, whom it was said she had been at pains to detach from Miss\n",
    "Mainwaring; but the conquest, it seems, was not designed for herself,\n",
    "or she has since transferred it to her daughter; for Sir James is now\n",
    "desperately in love with Frederica, and with full encouragement from\n",
    "mamma. The poor girl, however, I am sure, dislikes him; and though his\n",
    "person and address are very well, he appears, both to Mr. Vernon and\n",
    "me, a very weak young man. Frederica looked so shy, so confused, when\n",
    "we entered the room, that I felt for her exceedingly. Lady Susan behaved\n",
    "with great attention to her visitor; and yet I thought I could perceive\n",
    "that she had no particular pleasure in seeing him. Sir James talked a\n",
    "great deal, and made many civil excuses to me for the liberty he had\n",
    "taken in coming to Churchhill--mixing more frequent laughter with his\n",
    "discourse than the subject required--said many things over and over\n",
    "again, and told Lady Susan three times that he had seen Mrs. Johnson\n",
    "a few evenings before. He now and then addressed Frederica, but more\n",
    "frequently her mother. The poor girl sat all this time without opening\n",
    "her lips--her eyes cast down, and her colour varying every instant;\n",
    "while Reginald observed all that passed in perfect silence. At length\n",
    "Lady Susan, weary, I believe, of her situation, proposed walking; and\n",
    "we left the two gentlemen together, to put on our pelisses. As we went\n",
    "upstairs Lady Susan begged permission to attend me for a few moments in\n",
    "my dressing-room, as she was anxious to speak with me in private. I led\n",
    "her thither accordingly, and as soon as the door was closed, she said:\n",
    "\"I was never more surprized in my life than by Sir James's arrival,\n",
    "and the suddenness of it requires some apology to you, my dear sister;\n",
    "though to ME, as a mother, it is highly flattering. He is so extremely\n",
    "attached to my daughter that he could not exist longer without seeing\n",
    "her. Sir James is a young man of an amiable disposition and excellent\n",
    "character; a little too much of the rattle, perhaps, but a year or two\n",
    "will rectify THAT: and he is in other respects so very eligible a match\n",
    "for Frederica, that I have always observed his attachment with the\n",
    "greatest pleasure; and am persuaded that you and my brother will give\n",
    "the alliance your hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the\n",
    "likelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst\n",
    "Frederica continued at school it had better not be known to exist;\n",
    "but now, as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to\n",
    "school confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union\n",
    "with Sir James as not very distant, I had intended within a few days to\n",
    "acquaint yourself and Mr. Vernon with the whole business. I am sure, my\n",
    "dear sister, you will excuse my remaining silent so long, and agree\n",
    "with me that such circumstances, while they continue from any cause\n",
    "in suspense, cannot be too cautiously concealed. When you have the\n",
    "happiness of bestowing your sweet little Catherine, some years hence, on\n",
    "a man who in connection and character is alike unexceptionable, you\n",
    "will know what I feel now; though, thank Heaven, you cannot have all my\n",
    "reasons for rejoicing in such an event. Catherine will be amply provided\n",
    "for, and not, like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate\n",
    "establishment for the comforts of life.\" She concluded by demanding\n",
    "my congratulations. I gave them somewhat awkwardly, I believe; for, in\n",
    "fact, the sudden disclosure of so important a matter took from me the\n",
    "power of speaking with any clearness. She thanked me, however, most\n",
    "affectionately, for my kind concern in the welfare of herself and\n",
    "daughter; and then said: \"I am not apt to deal in professions, my\n",
    "dear Mrs. Vernon, and I never had the convenient talent of affecting\n",
    "sensations foreign to my heart; and therefore I trust you will believe\n",
    "me when I declare, that much as I had heard in your praise before I knew\n",
    "you, I had no idea that I should ever love you as I now do; and I\n",
    "must further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly\n",
    "gratifying because I have reason to believe that some attempts were made\n",
    "to prejudice you against me. I only wish that they, whoever they are,\n",
    "to whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the terms on\n",
    "which we now are together, and understand the real affection we feel\n",
    "for each other; but I will not detain you any longer. God bless you, for\n",
    "your goodness to me and my girl, and continue to you all your present\n",
    "happiness.\" What can one say of such a woman, my dear mother? Such\n",
    "earnestness such solemnity of expression! and yet I cannot help\n",
    "suspecting the truth of everything she says. As for Reginald, I believe\n",
    "he does not know what to make of the matter. When Sir James came, he\n",
    "appeared all astonishment and perplexity; the folly of the young man and\n",
    "the confusion of Frederica entirely engrossed him; and though a little\n",
    "private discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he is still\n",
    "hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a man's attentions to her\n",
    "daughter. Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain here\n",
    "a few days--hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being very\n",
    "impertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation; and concluded by\n",
    "wishing, with a laugh, that he might be really one very soon. Even Lady\n",
    "Susan seemed a little disconcerted by this forwardness; in her heart I\n",
    "am persuaded she sincerely wished him gone. But something must be done\n",
    "for this poor girl, if her feelings are such as both I and her uncle\n",
    "believe them to be. She must not be sacrificed to policy or ambition,\n",
    "and she must not be left to suffer from the dread of it. The girl whose\n",
    "heart can distinguish Reginald De Courcy, deserves, however he may\n",
    "slight her, a better fate than to be Sir James Martin's wife. As soon\n",
    "as I can get her alone, I will discover the real truth; but she seems to\n",
    "wish to avoid me. I hope this does not proceed from anything wrong, and\n",
    "that I shall not find out I have thought too well of her. Her\n",
    "behaviour to Sir James certainly speaks the greatest consciousness and\n",
    "embarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like encouragement. Adieu,\n",

    "Sir,--I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the\n",
    "greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very\n",
    "miserable about Sir James Martin, and have no other way in the world of\n",
    "helping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden even speaking\n",
    "to my uncle and aunt on the subject; and this being the case, I am\n",
    "afraid my applying to you will appear no better than equivocation, and\n",
    "as if I attended to the letter and not the spirit of mamma's commands.\n",
    "But if you do not take my part and persuade her to break it off, I shall\n",
    "be half distracted, for I cannot bear him. No human being but YOU could\n",
    "have any chance of prevailing with her. If you will, therefore, have the\n",
    "unspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading\n",
    "her to send Sir James away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is\n",
    "possible for me to express. I always disliked him from the first: it is\n",
    "not a sudden fancy, I assure you, sir; I always thought him silly and\n",
    "impertinent and disagreeable, and now he is grown worse than ever. I\n",
    "would rather work for my bread than marry him. I do not know how\n",
    "to apologize enough for this letter; I know it is taking so great a\n",
    "liberty. I am aware how dreadfully angry it will make mamma, but I\n",

    "Churchhill.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before,\n",
    "and must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into\n",
    "all my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin! Guess\n",
    "my astonishment, and vexation--for, as you well know, I never wished him\n",
    "to be seen at Churchhill. What a pity that you should not have known\n",
    "his intentions! Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to\n",
    "remain here a few days. I could have poisoned him! I made the best of\n",
    "it, however, and told my story with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who,\n",
    "whatever might be her real sentiments, said nothing in opposition to\n",
    "mine. I made a point also of Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James,\n",
    "and gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined on her\n",
    "marrying him. She said something of her misery, but that was all. I have\n",
    "for some time been more particularly resolved on the match from seeing\n",
    "the rapid increase of her affection for Reginald, and from not feeling\n",
    "secure that a knowledge of such affection might not in the end awaken\n",
    "a return. Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion must make\n",
    "them both in my eyes, I felt by no means assured that such might not be\n",
    "the consequence. It is true that Reginald had not in any degree grown\n",
    "cool towards me; but yet he has lately mentioned Frederica spontaneously\n",
    "and unnecessarily, and once said something in praise of her person.\n",
    "HE was all astonishment at the appearance of my visitor, and at first\n",
    "observed Sir James with an attention which I was pleased to see not\n",
    "unmixed with jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for me really\n",
    "to torment him, as Sir James, though extremely gallant to me, very\n",
    "soon made the whole party understand that his heart was devoted to my\n",
    "daughter. I had no great difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we\n",
    "were alone, that I was perfectly justified, all things considered,\n",
    "in desiring the match; and the whole business seemed most comfortably\n",
    "arranged. They could none of them help perceiving that Sir James was no\n",
    "Solomon; but I had positively forbidden Frederica complaining to Charles\n",
    "Vernon or his wife, and they had therefore no pretence for interference;\n",
    "though my impertinent sister, I believe, wanted only opportunity for\n",
    "doing so. Everything, however, was going on calmly and quietly; and,\n",
    "though I counted the hours of Sir James's stay, my mind was entirely\n",
    "satisfied with the posture of affairs. Guess, then, what I must feel at\n",
    "the sudden disturbance of all my schemes; and that, too, from a quarter\n",
    "where I had least reason to expect it. Reginald came this morning into\n",
    "my dressing-room with a very unusual solemnity of countenance, and after\n",
    "some preface informed me in so many words that he wished to reason with\n",
    "me on the impropriety and unkindness of allowing Sir James Martin to\n",
    "address my daughter contrary to her inclinations. I was all amazement.\n",
    "When I found that he was not to be laughed out of his design, I calmly\n",
    "begged an explanation, and desired to know by what he was impelled, and\n",
    "by whom commissioned, to reprimand me. He then told me, mixing in\n",
    "his speech a few insolent compliments and ill-timed expressions of\n",
    "tenderness, to which I listened with perfect indifference, that my\n",
    "daughter had acquainted him with some circumstances concerning herself,\n",
    "Sir James, and me which had given him great uneasiness. In short, I\n",
    "found that she had in the first place actually written to him to request\n",
    "his interference, and that, on receiving her letter, he had conversed\n",
    "with her on the subject of it, in order to understand the particulars,\n",
    "and to assure himself of her real wishes. I have not a doubt but that\n",
    "the girl took this opportunity of making downright love to him. I am\n",
    "convinced of it by the manner in which he spoke of her. Much good may\n",
    "such love do him! I shall ever despise the man who can be gratified by\n",
    "the passion which he never wished to inspire, nor solicited the avowal\n",
    "of. I shall always detest them both. He can have no true regard for\n",
    "me, or he would not have listened to her; and SHE, with her little\n",
    "rebellious heart and indelicate feelings, to throw herself into the\n",
    "protection of a young man with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged\n",
    "two words before! I am equally confounded at HER impudence and HIS\n",
    "credulity. How dared he believe what she told him in my disfavour! Ought\n",
    "he not to have felt assured that I must have unanswerable motives for\n",
    "all that I had done? Where was his reliance on my sense and goodness\n",
    "then? Where the resentment which true love would have dictated against\n",
    "the person defaming me--that person, too, a chit, a child, without\n",
    "talent or education, whom he had been always taught to despise? I\n",
    "was calm for some time; but the greatest degree of forbearance may be\n",
    "overcome, and I hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen. He endeavoured,\n",
    "long endeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that woman is a\n",
    "fool indeed who, while insulted by accusation, can be worked on by\n",
    "compliments. At length he left me, as deeply provoked as myself; and\n",
    "he showed his anger more. I was quite cool, but he gave way to the most\n",
    "violent indignation; I may therefore expect it will the sooner subside,\n",
    "and perhaps his may be vanished for ever, while mine will be found still\n",
    "fresh and implacable. He is now shut up in his apartment, whither I\n",
    "heard him go on leaving mine. How unpleasant, one would think, must be\n",
    "his reflections! but some people's feelings are incomprehensible. I have\n",
    "not yet tranquillised myself enough to see Frederica. SHE shall not soon\n",
    "forget the occurrences of this day; she shall find that she has poured\n",
    "forth her tender tale of love in vain, and exposed herself for ever\n",
    "to the contempt of the whole world, and the severest resentment of her\n",

    "Let me congratulate you, my dearest Mother! The affair which has given\n",
    "us so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our prospect is\n",
    "most delightful, and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn,\n",
    "I am quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; for the\n",
    "pleasure of learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased\n",
    "by all that you have previously suffered. I am so much agitated by\n",
    "delight that I can scarcely hold a pen; but am determined to send you\n",
    "a few short lines by James, that you may have some explanation of what\n",
    "must so greatly astonish you, as that Reginald should be returning to\n",
    "Parklands. I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in\n",
    "the breakfast parlour, when my brother called me out of the room. I\n",
    "instantly saw that something was the matter; his complexion was raised,\n",
    "and he spoke with great emotion; you know his eager manner, my dear\n",
    "mother, when his mind is interested. \"Catherine,\" said he, \"I am going\n",
    "home to-day; I am sorry to leave you, but I must go: it is a great while\n",
    "since I have seen my father and mother. I am going to send James forward\n",
    "with my hunters immediately; if you have any letter, therefore, he can\n",
    "take it. I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I\n",
    "shall go through London, where I have business; but before I leave you,\"\n",
    "he continued, speaking in a lower tone, and with still greater energy,\n",
    "\"I must warn you of one thing--do not let Frederica Vernon be made\n",
    "unhappy by that Martin. He wants to marry her; her mother promotes the\n",
    "match, but she cannot endure the idea of it. Be assured that I speak\n",
    "from the fullest conviction of the truth of what I say; I know that\n",
    "Frederica is made wretched by Sir James's continuing here. She is a\n",
    "sweet girl, and deserves a better fate. Send him away immediately; he is\n",
    "only a fool: but what her mother can mean, Heaven only knows! Good bye,\"\n",
    "he added, shaking my hand with earnestness; \"I do not know when you will\n",
    "see me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you MUST make\n",
    "it your business to see justice done her. She is an amiable girl, and\n",
    "has a very superior mind to what we have given her credit for.\" He then\n",
    "left me, and ran upstairs. I would not try to stop him, for I know what\n",
    "his feelings must be. The nature of mine, as I listened to him, I need\n",
    "not attempt to describe; for a minute or two I remained in the same\n",
    "spot, overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed; yet it\n",
    "required some consideration to be tranquilly happy. In about ten minutes\n",
    "after my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the room. I concluded,\n",
    "of course, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling; and looked with\n",
    "anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face. Mistress\n",
    "of deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after\n",
    "chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, \"I find\n",
    "from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy--is it true that\n",
    "he leaves Churchhill this morning?\" I replied that it was. \"He told\n",
    "us nothing of all this last night,\" said she, laughing, \"or even this\n",
    "morning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men\n",
    "are often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in forming\n",
    "than unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to\n",
    "change his mind at last, and not go.\" She soon afterwards left the room.\n",
    "I trust, however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear an\n",
    "alteration of his present plan; things have gone too far. They must have\n",
    "quarrelled, and about Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me. What\n",
    "delight will be yours in seeing him again; in seeing him still worthy\n",
    "your esteem, still capable of forming your happiness! When I next\n",
    "write I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone, Lady Susan\n",
    "vanquished, and Frederica at peace. We have much to do, but it shall\n",
    "be done. I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change was\n",
    "effected. I finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations.\n",

    "Little did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter,\n",
    "that the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo\n",
    "so speedy, so melancholy a reverse. I never can sufficiently regret that\n",
    "I wrote to you at all. Yet who could have foreseen what has happened?\n",
    "My dear mother, every hope which made me so happy only two hours ago has\n",
    "vanished. The quarrel between Lady Susan and Reginald is made up, and we\n",
    "are all as we were before. One point only is gained. Sir James Martin is\n",
    "dismissed. What are we now to look forward to? I am indeed disappointed;\n",
    "Reginald was all but gone, his horse was ordered and all but brought\n",
    "to the door; who would not have felt safe? For half an hour I was in\n",
    "momentary expectation of his departure. After I had sent off my letter\n",
    "to you, I went to Mr. Vernon, and sat with him in his room talking over\n",
    "the whole matter, and then determined to look for Frederica, whom I had\n",
    "not seen since breakfast. I met her on the stairs, and saw that she was\n",
    "crying. \"My dear aunt,\" said she, \"he is going--Mr. De Courcy is going,\n",
    "and it is all my fault. I am afraid you will be very angry with me, but\n",
    "indeed I had no idea it would end so.\" \"My love,\" I replied, \"do not\n",
    "think it necessary to apologize to me on that account. I shall feel\n",
    "myself under an obligation to anyone who is the means of sending my\n",
    "brother home, because,\" recollecting myself, \"I know my father wants\n",
    "very much to see him. But what is it you have done to occasion all\n",
    "this?\" She blushed deeply as she answered: \"I was so unhappy about Sir\n",
    "James that I could not help--I have done something very wrong, I know;\n",
    "but you have not an idea of the misery I have been in: and mamma had\n",
    "ordered me never to speak to you or my uncle about it, and--\" \"You\n",
    "therefore spoke to my brother to engage his interference,\" said I, to\n",
    "save her the explanation. \"No, but I wrote to him--I did indeed, I got\n",
    "up this morning before it was light, and was two hours about it; and\n",
    "when my letter was done I thought I never should have courage to give\n",
    "it. After breakfast however, as I was going to my room, I met him in the\n",
    "passage, and then, as I knew that everything must depend on that moment,\n",
    "I forced myself to give it. He was so good as to take it immediately. I\n",
    "dared not look at him, and ran away directly. I was in such a fright I\n",
    "could hardly breathe. My dear aunt, you do not know how miserable I\n",
    "have been.\" \"Frederica\" said I, \"you ought to have told me all your\n",
    "distresses. You would have found in me a friend always ready to assist\n",
    "you. Do you think that your uncle or I should not have espoused your\n",
    "cause as warmly as my brother?\" \"Indeed, I did not doubt your kindness,\"\n",
    "said she, colouring again, \"but I thought Mr. De Courcy could do\n",
    "anything with my mother; but I was mistaken: they have had a dreadful\n",
    "quarrel about it, and he is going away. Mamma will never forgive me,\n",
    "and I shall be worse off than ever.\" \"No, you shall not,\" I replied;\n",
    "\"in such a point as this your mother's prohibition ought not to have\n",
    "prevented your speaking to me on the subject. She has no right to\n",
    "make you unhappy, and she shall NOT do it. Your applying, however, to\n",
    "Reginald can be productive only of good to all parties. I believe it\n",
    "is best as it is. Depend upon it that you shall not be made unhappy any\n",
    "longer.\" At that moment how great was my astonishment at seeing Reginald\n",
    "come out of Lady Susan's dressing-room. My heart misgave me instantly.\n",
    "His confusion at seeing me was very evident. Frederica immediately\n",
    "disappeared. \"Are you going?\" I said; \"you will find Mr. Vernon in his\n",
    "own room.\" \"No, Catherine,\" he replied, \"I am not going. Will you let\n",
    "me speak to you a moment?\" We went into my room. \"I find,\" he continued,\n",
    "his confusion increasing as he spoke, \"that I have been acting with my\n",
    "usual foolish impetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, and\n",
    "was on the point of leaving the house under a false impression of\n",
    "her conduct. There has been some very great mistake; we have been all\n",
    "mistaken, I fancy. Frederica does not know her mother. Lady Susan means\n",
    "nothing but her good, but she will not make a friend of her. Lady Susan\n",
    "does not always know, therefore, what will make her daughter happy.\n",
    "Besides, I could have no right to interfere. Miss Vernon was mistaken in\n",
    "applying to me. In short, Catherine, everything has gone wrong, but it\n",
    "is now all happily settled. Lady Susan, I believe, wishes to speak to\n",
    "you about it, if you are at leisure.\" \"Certainly,\" I replied, deeply\n",
    "sighing at the recital of so lame a story. I made no comments, however,\n",
    "for words would have been vain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reginald was glad to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious,\n",
    "indeed, to hear her account of it. \"Did I not tell you,\" said she with\n",
    "a smile, \"that your brother would not leave us after all?\" \"You did,\n",
    "indeed,\" replied I very gravely; \"but I flattered myself you would be\n",
    "mistaken.\" \"I should not have hazarded such an opinion,\" returned she,\n",
    "\"if it had not at that moment occurred to me that his resolution of\n",
    "going might be occasioned by a conversation in which we had been this\n",
    "morning engaged, and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction,\n",
    "from our not rightly understanding each other's meaning. This idea\n",
    "struck me at the moment, and I instantly determined that an accidental\n",
    "dispute, in which I might probably be as much to blame as himself,\n",
    "should not deprive you of your brother. If you remember, I left the room\n",
    "almost immediately. I was resolved to lose no time in clearing up those\n",
    "mistakes as far as I could. The case was this--Frederica had set herself\n",
    "violently against marrying Sir James.\" \"And can your ladyship wonder\n",
    "that she should?\" cried I with some warmth; \"Frederica has an excellent\n",
    "understanding, and Sir James has none.\" \"I am at least very far from\n",
    "regretting it, my dear sister,\" said she; \"on the contrary, I am\n",
    "grateful for so favourable a sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is\n",
    "certainly below par (his boyish manners make him appear worse); and had\n",
    "Frederica possessed the penetration and the abilities which I could have\n",
    "wished in my daughter, or had I even known her to possess as much as she\n",
    "does, I should not have been anxious for the match.\" \"It is odd that\n",
    "you should alone be ignorant of your daughter's sense!\" \"Frederica never\n",
    "does justice to herself; her manners are shy and childish, and besides\n",
    "she is afraid of me. During her poor father's life she was a spoilt\n",
    "child; the severity which it has since been necessary for me to show\n",
    "has alienated her affection; neither has she any of that brilliancy\n",
    "of intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which will force itself\n",
    "forward.\" \"Say rather that she has been unfortunate in her education!\"\n",
    "\"Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am aware of that; but\n",
    "I would wish to forget every circumstance that might throw blame on the\n",
    "memory of one whose name is sacred with me.\" Here she pretended to cry;\n",
    "I was out of patience with her. \"But what,\" said I, \"was your ladyship\n",
    "going to tell me about your disagreement with my brother?\" \"It\n",
    "originated in an action of my daughter's, which equally marks her want\n",
    "of judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been mentioning--she\n",
    "wrote to Mr. De Courcy.\" \"I know she did; you had forbidden her speaking\n",
    "to Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she do,\n",
    "therefore, but apply to my brother?\" \"Good God!\" she exclaimed, \"what an\n",
    "opinion you must have of me! Can you possibly suppose that I was\n",
    "aware of her unhappiness! that it was my object to make my own child\n",
    "miserable, and that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the subject\n",
    "from a fear of your interrupting the diabolical scheme? Do you think\n",
    "me destitute of every honest, every natural feeling? Am I capable of\n",
    "consigning HER to everlasting misery whose welfare it is my first\n",
    "earthly duty to promote? The idea is horrible!\" \"What, then, was your\n",
    "intention when you insisted on her silence?\" \"Of what use, my dear\n",
    "sister, could be any application to you, however the affair might stand?\n",
    "Why should I subject you to entreaties which I refused to attend to\n",
    "myself? Neither for your sake nor for hers, nor for my own, could such\n",
    "a thing be desirable. When my own resolution was taken I could not\n",
    "wish for the interference, however friendly, of another person. I was\n",
    "mistaken, it is true, but I believed myself right.\" \"But what was this\n",
    "mistake to which your ladyship so often alludes! from whence arose so\n",
    "astonishing a misconception of your daughter's feelings! Did you not\n",
    "know that she disliked Sir James?\" \"I knew that he was not absolutely\n",
    "the man she would have chosen, but I was persuaded that her objections\n",
    "to him did not arise from any perception of his deficiency. You must\n",
    "not question me, however, my dear sister, too minutely on this point,\"\n",
    "continued she, taking me affectionately by the hand; \"I honestly own\n",
    "that there is something to conceal. Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her\n",
    "applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly.\" \"What is it you mean\n",
    "to infer,\" said I, \"by this appearance of mystery? If you think your\n",
    "daughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to Sir James could\n",
    "not less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her objecting\n",
    "had been a consciousness of his folly; and why should your ladyship,\n",
    "at any rate, quarrel with my brother for an interference which, you must\n",
    "know, it is not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a manner?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"His disposition, you know, is warm, and he came to expostulate with\n",
    "me; his compassion all alive for this ill-used girl, this heroine in\n",
    "distress! We misunderstood each other: he believed me more to blame than\n",
    "I really was; I considered his interference less excusable than I\n",
    "now find it. I have a real regard for him, and was beyond expression\n",
    "mortified to find it, as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were both warm,\n",
    "and of course both to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchhill is\n",
    "consistent with his general eagerness. When I understood his intention,\n",
    "however, and at the same time began to think that we had been perhaps\n",
    "equally mistaken in each other's meaning, I resolved to have an\n",
    "explanation before it was too late. For any member of your family I must\n",
    "always feel a degree of affection, and I own it would have sensibly hurt\n",
    "me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so gloomily. I have\n",
    "now only to say further, that as I am convinced of Frederica's having\n",
    "a reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall instantly inform him that he\n",
    "must give up all hope of her. I reproach myself for having, even though\n",
    "innocently, made her unhappy on that score. She shall have all the\n",
    "retribution in my power to make; if she value her own happiness as much\n",
    "as I do, if she judge wisely, and command herself as she ought, she may\n",
    "now be easy. Excuse me, my dearest sister, for thus trespassing on your\n",
    "time, but I owe it to my own character; and after this explanation I\n",
    "trust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion.\" I could have\n",
    "said, \"Not much, indeed!\" but I left her almost in silence. It was\n",
    "the greatest stretch of forbearance I could practise. I could not have\n",
    "stopped myself had I begun. Her assurance! her deceit! but I will not\n",
    "allow myself to dwell on them; they will strike you sufficiently. My\n",
    "heart sickens within me. As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned\n",
    "to the parlour. Sir James's carriage was at the door, and he, merry\n",
    "as usual, soon afterwards took his leave. How easily does her ladyship\n",
    "encourage or dismiss a lover! In spite of this release, Frederica still\n",
    "looks unhappy: still fearful, perhaps, of her mother's anger; and though\n",
    "dreading my brother's departure, jealous, it may be, of his staying. I\n",
    "see how closely she observes him and Lady Susan, poor girl! I have now\n",
    "no hope for her. There is not a chance of her affection being returned.\n",
    "He thinks very differently of her from what he used to do; he does her\n",
    "some justice, but his reconciliation with her mother precludes every\n",
    "dearer hope. Prepare, my dear mother, for the worst! The probability of\n",
    "their marrying is surely heightened! He is more securely hers than ever.\n",
    "When that wretched event takes place, Frederica must belong wholly to\n",
    "us. I am thankful that my last letter will precede this by so little, as\n",
    "every moment that you can be saved from feeling a joy which leads only\n",
    "to disappointment is of consequence.\n",

    "I call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am my own self, gay\n",
    "and triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in\n",
    "high irritation, and with ample cause. Nay, I know not whether I ought\n",
    "to be quite tranquil now, for I have had more trouble in restoring\n",
    "peace than I ever intended to submit to--a spirit, too, resulting from\n",
    "a fancied sense of superior integrity, which is peculiarly insolent! I\n",
    "shall not easily forgive him, I assure you. He was actually on the point\n",
    "of leaving Churchhill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson\n",
    "brought me word of it. I found, therefore, that something must be done;\n",
    "for I did not choose to leave my character at the mercy of a man whose\n",
    "passions are so violent and so revengeful. It would have been trifling\n",
    "with my reputation to allow of his departing with such an impression in\n",
    "my disfavour; in this light, condescension was necessary. I sent\n",
    "Wilson to say that I desired to speak with him before he went; he came\n",
    "immediately. The angry emotions which had marked every feature when we\n",
    "last parted were partially subdued. He seemed astonished at the summons,\n",
    "and looked as if half wishing and half fearing to be softened by what I\n",
    "might say. If my countenance expressed what I aimed at, it was composed\n",
    "and dignified; and yet, with a degree of pensiveness which might\n",
    "convince him that I was not quite happy. \"I beg your pardon, sir, for\n",
    "the liberty I have taken in sending for you,\" said I; \"but as I have\n",
    "just learnt your intention of leaving this place to-day, I feel it my\n",
    "duty to entreat that you will not on my account shorten your visit here\n",
    "even an hour. I am perfectly aware that after what has passed between\n",
    "us it would ill suit the feelings of either to remain longer in the same\n",
    "house: so very great, so total a change from the intimacy of friendship\n",
    "must render any future intercourse the severest punishment; and your\n",
    "resolution of quitting Churchhill is undoubtedly in unison with our\n",
    "situation, and with those lively feelings which I know you to possess.\n",
    "But, at the same time, it is not for me to suffer such a sacrifice as it\n",
    "must be to leave relations to whom you are so much attached, and are so\n",
    "dear. My remaining here cannot give that pleasure to Mr. and Mrs. Vernon\n",
    "which your society must; and my visit has already perhaps been too long.\n",
    "My removal, therefore, which must, at any rate, take place soon, may,\n",
    "with perfect convenience, be hastened; and I make it my particular\n",
    "request that I may not in any way be instrumental in separating a\n",
    "family so affectionately attached to each other. Where I go is of\n",
    "no consequence to anyone; of very little to myself; but you are of\n",
    "importance to all your connections.\" Here I concluded, and I hope you\n",
    "will be satisfied with my speech. Its effect on Reginald justifies some\n",
    "portion of vanity, for it was no less favourable than instantaneous. Oh,\n",
    "how delightful it was to watch the variations of his countenance while I\n",
    "spoke! to see the struggle between returning tenderness and the remains\n",
    "of displeasure. There is something agreeable in feelings so easily\n",
    "worked on; not that I envy him their possession, nor would, for the\n",
    "world, have such myself; but they are very convenient when one wishes\n",
    "to influence the passions of another. And yet this Reginald, whom a\n",
    "very few words from me softened at once into the utmost submission, and\n",
    "rendered more tractable, more attached, more devoted than ever, would\n",
    "have left me in the first angry swelling of his proud heart without\n",
    "deigning to seek an explanation. Humbled as he now is, I cannot forgive\n",
    "him such an instance of pride, and am doubtful whether I ought not to\n",
    "punish him by dismissing him at once after this reconciliation, or\n",
    "by marrying and teazing him for ever. But these measures are each too\n",
    "violent to be adopted without some deliberation; at present my thoughts\n",
    "are fluctuating between various schemes. I have many things to compass:\n",
    "I must punish Frederica, and pretty severely too, for her application to\n",
    "Reginald; I must punish him for receiving it so favourably, and for the\n",
    "rest of his conduct. I must torment my sister-in-law for the insolent\n",
    "triumph of her look and manner since Sir James has been dismissed; for,\n",
    "in reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that ill-fated\n",
    "young man; and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which\n",
    "I have stooped within these few days. To effect all this I have various\n",
    "plans. I have also an idea of being soon in town; and whatever may be\n",
    "my determination as to the rest, I shall probably put THAT project\n",
    "in execution; for London will be always the fairest field of action,\n",
    "however my views may be directed; and at any rate I shall there be\n",
    "rewarded by your society, and a little dissipation, for a ten weeks'\n",
    "penance at Churchhill. I believe I owe it to my character to complete\n",
    "the match between my daughter and Sir James after having so long\n",
    "intended it. Let me know your opinion on this point. Flexibility of\n",
    "mind, a disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which you\n",
    "know I am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any claim\n",
    "to the indulgence of her notions at the expense of her mother's\n",
    "inclinations. Her idle love for Reginald, too! It is surely my duty to\n",
    "discourage such romantic nonsense. All things considered, therefore, it\n",
    "seems incumbent on me to take her to town and marry her immediately to\n",
    "Sir James. When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have\n",
    "some credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in\n",
    "fact, I have not; for though he is still in my power, I have given up\n",
    "the very article by which our quarrel was produced, and at best the\n",
    "honour of victory is doubtful. Send me your opinion on all these\n",

    "behind. It would surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself well\n",
    "established by marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him and the rest\n",
    "of his family by making her marry Sir James. You should think more of\n",
    "yourself and less of your daughter. She is not of a disposition to do\n",
    "you credit in the world, and seems precisely in her proper place at\n",
    "Churchhill, with the Vernons. But you are fitted for society, and it\n",
    "is shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore,\n",
    "to punish herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that\n",
    "romantic tender-heartedness which will always ensure her misery enough,\n",
    "and come to London as soon as you can. I have another reason for urging\n",
    "this: Mainwaring came to town last week, and has contrived, in spite\n",
    "of Mr. Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is absolutely\n",
    "miserable about you, and jealous to such a degree of De Courcy that it\n",
    "would be highly unadvisable for them to meet at present. And yet, if you\n",
    "do not allow him to see you here, I cannot answer for his not committing\n",
    "some great imprudence--such as going to Churchhill, for instance, which\n",
    "would be dreadful! Besides, if you take my advice, and resolve to marry\n",
    "De Courcy, it will be indispensably necessary to you to get Mainwaring\n",
    "out of the way; and you only can have influence enough to send him back\n",
    "to his wife. I have still another motive for your coming: Mr. Johnson\n",
    "leaves London next Tuesday; he is going for his health to Bath, where,\n",

    "be laid up with the gout many weeks. During his absence we shall be able\n",
    "to chuse our own society, and to have true enjoyment. I would ask you to\n",
    "Edward Street, but that once he forced from me a kind of promise never\n",
    "to invite you to my house; nothing but my being in the utmost distress\n",
    "for money should have extorted it from me. I can get you, however,\n",
    "a nice drawing-room apartment in Upper Seymour Street, and we may be\n",
    "always together there or here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson\n",
    "as comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the\n",
    "house. Poor Mainwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy.\n",
    "Silly woman to expect constancy from so charming a man! but she always\n",

    "I have received your letter, and though I do not attempt to conceal that\n",
    "I am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet\n",
    "feel myself under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time\n",
    "originally fixed. Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my\n",
    "power, nor accuse me of instability without first hearing my reasons.\n",
    "In the course of my journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for\n",
    "reflection on the present state of our affairs, and every review has\n",
    "served to convince me that they require a delicacy and cautiousness of\n",
    "conduct to which we have hitherto been too little attentive. We have\n",
    "been hurried on by our feelings to a degree of precipitation which ill\n",
    "accords with the claims of our friends or the opinion of the world. We\n",
    "have been unguarded in forming this hasty engagement, but we must not\n",
    "complete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason\n",
    "to fear the connection would be opposed by those friends on whom you\n",
    "depend. It is not for us to blame any expectations on your father's side\n",
    "of your marrying to advantage; where possessions are so extensive as\n",
    "those of your family, the wish of increasing them, if not strictly\n",
    "reasonable, is too common to excite surprize or resentment. He has a\n",
    "right to require; a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law, and I am\n",
    "sometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a connection\n",
    "so imprudent; but the influence of reason is often acknowledged too late\n",
    "by those who feel like me. I have now been but a few months a widow,\n",
    "and, however little indebted to my husband's memory for any happiness\n",
    "derived from him during a union of some years, I cannot forget that the\n",
    "indelicacy of so early a second marriage must subject me to the censure\n",
    "of the world, and incur, what would be still more insupportable, the\n",
    "displeasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps harden myself in time against\n",
    "the injustice of general reproach, but the loss of HIS valued esteem\n",
    "I am, as you well know, ill-fitted to endure; and when to this may be\n",
    "added the consciousness of having injured you with your family, how am I\n",
    "to support myself? With feelings so poignant as mine, the conviction of\n",
    "having divided the son from his parents would make me, even with you,\n",
    "the most miserable of beings. It will surely, therefore, be advisable to\n",
    "delay our union--to delay it till appearances are more promising--till\n",
    "affairs have taken a more favourable turn. To assist us in such a\n",
    "resolution I feel that absence will be necessary. We must not meet.\n",
    "Cruel as this sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing it,\n",
    "which can alone reconcile it to myself, will be evident to you when you\n",
    "have considered our situation in the light in which I have found myself\n",
    "imperiously obliged to place it. You may be--you must be--well assured\n",
    "that nothing but the strongest conviction of duty could induce me\n",
    "to wound my own feelings by urging a lengthened separation, and of\n",
    "insensibility to yours you will hardly suspect me. Again, therefore,\n",
    "I say that we ought not, we must not, yet meet. By a removal for some\n",
    "months from each other we shall tranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs.\n",
    "Vernon, who, accustomed herself to the enjoyment of riches, considers\n",
    "fortune as necessary everywhere, and whose sensibilities are not of a\n",
    "nature to comprehend ours. Let me hear from you soon--very soon. Tell me\n",
    "that you submit to my arguments, and do not reproach me for using such.\n",
    "I cannot bear reproaches: my spirits are not so high as to need being\n",
    "repressed. I must endeavour to seek amusement, and fortunately many\n",
    "of my friends are in town; amongst them the Mainwarings; you know how\n",

    "that if she were in any distress we should be always her friends. I took\n",
    "care to see her alone, that I might say all this, and I hope made her a\n",
    "little more comfortable; but I shall not be easy till I can go to town\n",

    "Having learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother,\n",
    "of what had passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower\n",
    "than ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get\n",
    "Frederica removed from such a mother, and placed under her own care;\n",
    "and, though with little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing\n",
    "unattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her sister-in-law's\n",
    "consent to it. Her anxiety on the subject made her press for an early\n",
    "visit to London; and Mr. Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared,\n",
    "lived only to do whatever he was desired, soon found some accommodating\n",
    "business to call him thither. With a heart full of the matter, Mrs.\n",
    "Vernon waited on Lady Susan shortly after her arrival in town, and was\n",
    "met with such an easy and cheerful affection, as made her almost turn\n",
    "from her with horror. No remembrance of Reginald, no consciousness of\n",
    "guilt, gave one look of embarrassment; she was in excellent spirits, and\n",
    "seemed eager to show at once by ever possible attention to her brother\n",
    "and sister her sense of their kindness, and her pleasure in their\n",
    "society. Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same\n",
    "restrained manners, the same timid look in the presence of her mother as\n",
    "heretofore, assured her aunt of her situation being uncomfortable, and\n",
    "confirmed her in the plan of altering it. No unkindness, however, on the\n",
    "part of Lady Susan appeared. Persecution on the subject of Sir James was\n",
    "entirely at an end; his name merely mentioned to say that he was not in\n",
    "London; and indeed, in all her conversation, she was solicitous only for\n",
    "the welfare and improvement of her daughter, acknowledging, in terms of\n",
    "grateful delight, that Frederica was now growing every day more and more\n",
    "what a parent could desire. Mrs. Vernon, surprized and incredulous,\n",
    "knew not what to suspect, and, without any change in her own views,\n",
    "only feared greater difficulty in accomplishing them. The first hope\n",
    "of anything better was derived from Lady Susan's asking her whether she\n",
    "thought Frederica looked quite as well as she had done at Churchhill, as\n",
    "she must confess herself to have sometimes an anxious doubt of London's\n",
    "perfectly agreeing with her. Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt,\n",
    "directly proposed her niece's returning with them into the country. Lady\n",
    "Susan was unable to express her sense of such kindness, yet knew not,\n",
    "from a variety of reasons, how to part with her daughter; and as, though\n",
    "her own plans were not yet wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long\n",
    "be in her power to take Frederica into the country herself, concluded by\n",
    "declining entirely to profit by such unexampled attention. Mrs. Vernon\n",
    "persevered, however, in the offer of it, and though Lady Susan continued\n",
    "to resist, her resistance in the course of a few days seemed somewhat\n",
    "less formidable. The lucky alarm of an influenza decided what might not\n",
    "have been decided quite so soon. Lady Susan's maternal fears were then\n",
    "too much awakened for her to think of anything but Frederica's removal\n",
    "from the risk of infection; above all disorders in the world she most\n",
    "dreaded the influenza for her daughter's constitution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Frederica returned to Churchhill with her uncle and aunt; and three\n",
    "weeks afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to Sir James\n",
    "Martin. Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected\n",
    "before, that she might have spared herself all the trouble of urging\n",
    "a removal which Lady Susan had doubtless resolved on from the first.\n",
    "Frederica's visit was nominally for six weeks, but her mother, though\n",
    "inviting her to return in one or two affectionate letters, was very\n",
    "ready to oblige the whole party by consenting to a prolongation of her\n",
    "stay, and in the course of two months ceased to write of her absence,\n",
    "and in the course of two or more to write to her at all. Frederica was\n",
    "therefore fixed in the family of her uncle and aunt till such time as\n",
    "Reginald De Courcy could be talked, flattered, and finessed into an\n",
    "affection for her which, allowing leisure for the conquest of his\n",
    "attachment to her mother, for his abjuring all future attachments, and\n",
    "detesting the sex, might be reasonably looked for in the course of a\n",
    "twelvemonth. Three months might have done it in general, but Reginald's\n",
    "feelings were no less lasting than lively. Whether Lady Susan was or\n",
    "was not happy in her second choice, I do not see how it can ever be\n",
    "ascertained; for who would take her assurance of it on either side of\n",
    "the question? The world must judge from probabilities; she had nothing\n",
    "against her but her husband, and her conscience. Sir James may seem to\n",
    "have drawn a harder lot than mere folly merited; I leave him, therefore,\n",
    "to all the pity that anybody can give him. For myself, I confess that I\n",
    "can pity only Miss Mainwaring; who, coming to town, and putting herself\n",
    "to an expense in clothes which impoverished her for two years, on\n",
    "purpose to secure him, was defrauded of her due by a woman ten years\n",
    "older than herself."
