Here are the regex expressions I used:Â 

1. .*(?=^SCENE:) uses positive look ahead to find first place in text where SCENE is listed. Delete all text above SCENE.

Delete everything after -THE END-

2. \n(^\S+\n)
Replace with $1 (to only delete new line and preserve text)

Looks for newline and next character at beginning of line with no space (one or more) and new line

3. ^\S.*\n
Replace with \n to preserve formatting

This looks for lines with two or more non-blanks (titles) and everything left justified (any non-space character, anything followed by new line)

4. \s{2,}.*^\s{2}

This looks at any spaces (at least 2 consecutive) and then looks at the beginning of the next line for two or more spaces (to remove large blocks of spaces)
Replace with \n and 2 spaces so that line beginnings are all same

5. \s{8,}.*
Replace with \n and 2 spaces

Removes right justified text with "exit" cues for actors

6. (^\s{1,4})[A-Z\s]*\.
Starting at new line find from 1 to 4 spaces. Then look for capital letter characters, any number followed by any spaces. Also include the . with \.
Replace with $1 to remove text and maintain spacing

7. (^\s+)[A-Z]{3,}\.?
Find remaining character names that do not necessarily include . at end
Replace with $1

8. \[.*\]
Find asides in []
